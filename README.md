## Git Workflow
**Merge Conflict Rule:**
Pull main and merge main to the branch you are on. Solve merge conflicts locally!

**Branch creation (create from issue through GitLab or be consistent with the naming):**
If issue is "#1 Parse recording file", you would create the branch after:
1-parse-recording-file

## Style guide for commits:
```
git commit -m "#1 <<Present tense verb noun - what it does>>" -m "<<longer commit message e.g. Co-authored by rowley@student.chalmers.se optional... >>"
```
Concrete Example:
```
git commit -m "#1 Implements parsing for rec files" -m "Works using xyz encoding. Co-authored by rowley@student.chalmers.se"
```
